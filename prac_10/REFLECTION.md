# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracy varied across practicals. For simpler tasks like the temperature conversion in 
`prac_01/temperatures.py` and sales bonus calculation in `prac_01/sales_bonus.py`, I accurately estimated the time. 
However, for more complex tasks such as the project management system in `prac_07/project_management.py` and the taxi 
simulator in `prac_09/taxi_simulator.py`, I often underestimated the time due to unforeseen challenges in implementing
class interactions and handling user input.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As the course advanced, my estimate accuracy improved. After working on multiple practicals, I became more aware of 
potential issues like file I/O errors in `prac_03/files.py` and inheritance complexities in `prac_09/unreliable_car.py`. 
For example, in later practicals, I allocated extra time for debugging and testing edge cases, which helped me make more 
realistic estimates.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that accurate time estimation requires a thorough understanding of the task requirements and potential 
difficulties. Breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps, as I did when implementing the Kivy applications in 
`prac_08`, was crucial. Additionally, past experiences with similar tasks, such as using CSV files in 
`prac_05/wimbledon.py` and `prac_07/language_file_reader.py`, provided valuable insights for future estimations.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Being reviewed by others has been eye - opening. I've learned about best practices in code organization and readability. 
For instance, in my Kivy code like `prac_08/squaring.py`, reviewers suggested separating the business logic from the UI 
code, which made the code more modular and easier to maintain. I also became more aware of the importance of error 
handling, as highlighted in `prac_03/exceptions_demo.py`.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Reviewing others' code has enhanced my understanding of programming concepts. Analyzing their solutions for tasks like 
list comprehensions in `prac_04/list_comprehensions.py` and class inheritance in `prac_09/silver_service_taxi.py` helped 
me identify different approaches and potential improvements. It also taught me to communicate feedback constructively, 
ensuring that the suggestions were clear and helpful.

### Good Code Review 1

### Explanation

In this review, I examined the code for the guitar management system in `prac_07/myguitars.py`. I pointed out issues 
with sorting logic and suggested using the `__lt__` method more effectively as demonstrated in `prac_07/guitar.py`. 
I also provided specific examples and explanations to help the developer understand the changes needed.

### Good Code Review 2

[Link to PR #8](https://github.com/ZhigangQiao/cp1404practicals/pull/8)

### Explanation

For the car and taxi classes in `prac_09`, I reviewed the code for proper inheritance and method overriding. 
I identified redundant code in the `get_fare` method of `SilverServiceTaxi` and proposed refactoring it to call 
the parent class's method more efficiently, similar to the implementation in `prac_09/silver_service_taxi.py`.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

If I were in charge, I would incorporate more real - world projects. For example, building a simple web application 
using Python frameworks to demonstrate practical applications. I would also provide more detailed examples of 
industry- standard code, similar to the Kivy applications but with more advanced features, to help students bridge the 
gap between academic learning and real - world development.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I excelled at applying theoretical concepts to practical coding. For instance, I effectively used 
object - oriented programming principles in creating classes like `Car` in `prac_06/car.py` and `Guitar` in 
`prac_07/guitar.py`. I was also consistent in testing my code, using unit tests in `prac_09/unreliable_car_test.py` 
and manual testing for user - input applications, which helped me identify and fix bugs early.
