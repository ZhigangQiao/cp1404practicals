# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have become more consistent with my weekly practice by setting aside dedicated time to work on coding tasks and 
reflect on my progress. I’ve also started taking more notes during pracs and lectures to help reinforce my understanding
and make it easier to review before assessments.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I still need to improve how I manage my time during the week. Sometimes I leave prac work too late, which makes it 
harder to fully understand the material before moving on to the next topic. I also need to be more proactive in seeking 
help when I’m stuck, instead of spending too long trying to solve everything on my own.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I’m doing well at applying concepts from lectures into practical coding exercises. I regularly test my code and try to 
understand error messages, which has helped improve my debugging skills. I’ve also been using Git effectively to track 
my progress, which I’ll continue to do.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop rushing through tasks just to complete them. Instead, I should focus more on understanding the “why” 
behind the code. I also need to revise earlier topics more regularly to keep the concepts fresh in my mind.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

It would be helpful to have more real-world coding examples and mini-projects that show how Python is used in industry. 
This could improve motivation and help students better understand the practical applications of what they’re learning.
