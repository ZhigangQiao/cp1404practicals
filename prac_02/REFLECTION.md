# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

85%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I usually watch the lecture videos at home in the evenings around 7–8pm, for about an hour. 
I’ve been trying to stick to a consistent routine mid-week.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I’ve been staying on top of the practicals and consistently completing them before the deadline. 
I also make notes during lectures and revisit them when working on assignments, which has helped my understanding.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to avoid leaving tasks until the last minute. Although I meet deadlines, 
the quality could be improved if I spaced out my work better and had time for proper revision.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Sometimes I skip reading all the instructions thoroughly before starting, 
which leads to small errors or missing out on bonus tasks. I’ll aim to read the practical instructions more carefully 
and follow each step.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I’ve been applying concepts from lectures to the practicals effectively and testing my code thoroughly. 
I also ask questions when I’m stuck, either during class or through the discussion forums.
